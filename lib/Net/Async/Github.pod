=head1 NAME

Net::Async::Github - support for the L<https://github.com> REST API with L<IO::Async>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use IO::Async::Loop;
 use Net::Async::Github;
 my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;
 $loop->add(
  my $gh = Net::Async::Github->new(
   token => '...',
  )
 );
 # Give 'secret_team' pull access to all private repos
 $gh->repos(visibility => 'private')
    ->grant_team(secret_team => 'pull')
    ->await;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a basic wrapper for Github's API.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 current_user

Returns information about the current user.

 my $user = $gh->current_user->get;
 printf "User [%s] has %d public repos and was last updated on %s%s\n",
  $user->login, $user->public_repos, $user->updated_at->to_string

Resolves to a L<Net::Async::Github::User> instance.

=head2 configure

Accepts the following optional named parameters:

=over 4

=item * C<token> - the Github API token

=item * C<endpoints> - hashref of L<RFC6570|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570>-compliant URL mappings

=item * C<http> - an HTTP client compatible with the L<Net::Async::HTTP> API

=item * C<mime_type> - the MIME type to use as the C<Accept> header for requests

=item * C<page_cache_size> - number of GET responses to cache. Defaults to 1000, set to 0 to disable.

=back

B<<  You probably just want C<token>  >>, defaults should be fine for the
other settings.

If you're creating a large number of instances, you can avoid
some disk access overhead by passing C<endpoints> from an existing
instance to the constructor for a new instance.

=head2 reopen

Reopens the given PR.

Expects the following named parameters:

=over 4

=item * owner - which user or organisation owns this PR

=item * repo - which repo it's for

=item * id - the pull request ID

=back

Resolves to the current status.

=head2 pr

Returns information about the given PR.

Expects the following named parameters:

=over 4

=item * owner - which user or organisation owns this PR

=item * repo - which repo it's for

=item * id - the pull request ID

=back

Resolves to the current status.

=head2 user

Returns information about the given user.

=head2 users

Iterates through all users. This is a good way to exhaust your 5000-query
ratelimiting quota.

=head2 head

Identifies the head version for this branch.

Requires the following named parameters:

=over 4

=item * owner - which organisation or person owns the repo

=item * repo - the repository name

=item * branch - which branch to check

=back

=head2 update

=head2 core_rate_limit

Returns a L<Net::Async::Github::RateLimit::Core> instance which can track rate limits.

=head2 rate_limit

=head1 METHODS - Internal

The following methods are used internally. They're not expected to be
useful for external callers.

=head2 api_key

=head2 token

=head2 endpoints

Returns an accessor for the endpoints data. This is a hashref containing URI
templates, used by L</endpoint>.

=head2 endpoint

Expands the selected URI via L<URI::Template>. Each item is defined in our C< endpoints.json >
file.

Returns a L<URI> instance.

=head2 http

Accessor for the HTTP client object. Will load and instantiate a L<Net::Async::HTTP> instance
if necessary.

Actual HTTP implementation is not guaranteed, and the default is likely to change in future.

=head2 auth_info

Returns authentication information used in the HTTP request.

=head2 mime_type

Returns the MIME type used for requests. Currently defined by github in
L<https://developer.github.com/v3/media/> as C<application/vnd.github.v3+json>.

=head2 base_uri

The L<URI> for requests. Defaults to L<https://api.github.com>.

=head2 http_get

Performs an HTTP GET request.

=head2 pending_requests

A list of all pending requests.

=head2 validate_branch_name

Applies validation rules from L<git-check-ref-format> for a branch name.

Will raise an exception on invalid input.

=head2 validate_owner_name

Applies github rules for user/organisation name.

Will raise an exception on invalid input.

=head2 validate_repo_name

Applies github rules for repository name.

Will raise an exception on invalid input.

=head2 validate_args

Convenience method to apply validation on common parameters.

=head2 page_cache_size

Returns the total number of GET responses we'll cache. Default is probably 1000.

=head2 page_cache

The page cache instance, likely to be provided by L<Cache::LRU>.
=cut

sub page_cache {
    $_[0]->{page_cache} //= do {
        Cache::LRU->new(
            size => $_[0]->page_cache_size
        )
    }
}

=head2 ryu

Our L<Ryu::Async> instance, used for instantiating L<Ryu::Source> instances.

=head1 INHERITED METHODS

=over 4
